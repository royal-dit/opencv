hough transform basiscs
Used to detect straight line in image



A line in the image space can be expressed with two variable 
cartesian coordianate system y = mx+c
polar coordinate system = xcos0 + ysin0 = r



Hough line transformation is used to detect straight lines in an image. 
It works by transforming the image into a parameter space, where each 
point in the image corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in the parameter space.
The intersection points of these curves represent the possible lines in the image.
The Hough transform is useful because it can detect lines that are partially obscured or broken,
which can be difficult to detect using other methods. Additionally,
it is relatively insensitive to noise and can be used to detect lines in noisy images.
